`shbin` turns a Github repo into a pastebin. 

It's a tiny command-line tool we've built at
[Shiphero](http://shiphero.com) that lets you easily upload code
snippets, notebooks, images, or any other file to a Github repository
that acts as your internal pastebin, and returns the URL to share it
with your team. If possible, this URL is automatically copied to the
clipboard.
